# Qtpi Overview

## Mission

We strive to build meaningful bonds and empower individuals with ethical technological solutions.

## Core Values

* **Integrity:** Driven by a principled approach, we share transparently and honestly, fostering a foundation of trust and ethical conduct in all user interactions.
* **Agency:** Empower users to take control of their dating experience, enabling them to make choices that align with their values.
* **Thoughtfulness:** We approach every aspect of our platform with care and consideration, striving for human-centered design.

## Principles

* **Align Incentives:** We center our business on a pay-per-mutual-match model, purposefully designing it so our success directly links to users forming meaningful relationships.
* **Scientific Matching:** We incorporate evidence-based methods to assess compatibility that go beyond hobbies and interests.
* **Trust and Safety:** We foster a secure and transparent environment where community trust flourishes and helps bridge the polarization often found in dating.
