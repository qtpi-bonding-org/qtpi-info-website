# FAQs about Qtpi

## What makes Qtpi different from traditional dating apps?
Qtpi is designed to prioritize meaningful connections through a unique business model, evidence-based matching, a focus on user privacy, and a commitment to building trust within the community. We aim to create a dating experience that aligns with users' needs rather than treating them like products.

## How does Qtpi ensure that I’m matched with compatible users?
Qtpi employs a rules-based system that prioritizes your input over algorithms. We utilize evidence-based methods, such as the Big Five Personality Test, to evaluate compatibility based on personality traits, values, and communication styles, rather than solely on hobbies or physical appearances. For every question we ask about yourself, you also have the option to specify how you would like your potential partner to respond.

## How does Qtpi address the issue of superficial matching?
We go beyond surface-level matching by using a double-blind system where personal information and photos are scrambled. This allows users to focus on deeper aspects of compatibility, such as lifestyle preferences and personality traits, before revealing identities.

## Are filters available for free?
Yes! Unlike many dating apps that lock filters behind a paywall, Qtpi provides all filters for free, allowing you to find connections that meet your preferences without any additional costs.

## What incentives do I have to engage meaningfully with matches?
Since every match costs money, users are naturally encouraged to interact thoughtfully and build genuine connections. This model promotes deeper conversations and relationships rather than superficial swiping.

The financial investment from both users fosters a sense of commitment, which is supported by **commitment theory**. For example, when individuals pay for a gym membership, they often feel compelled to attend regularly to avoid wasting their investment. This same principle applies to our app: when users invest financially in their matches, they are more likely to engage seriously and pursue meaningful interactions.

As a result, this commitment incentivizes users to prioritize quality connections, ultimately increasing the likelihood of going on actual dates and fostering fulfilling, lasting relationships.

## How does the Pay Per Match system work?
Qtpi uses a Pay Per Match system, allowing you to pay only when you successfully match with someone. This ensures we are motivated to connect you with users you genuinely want to match with, ensuring that we work for you.

### What are pledges?
Pledges are a type of currency within the app that you use to indicate your interest in other users.

### Do I get free pledges?
Yes! Every new account starts with 3 free pledges, allowing you to explore the app without any initial cost.

### What happens when I use a pledge?
When you use a pledge to show interest in another user, it is "tied up" for one week. During this time, the pledge is temporarily unavailable for you to use on other users until the recipient responds. If you want to express interest in more users at the same time, consider purchasing additional pledges to keep your options open. 

## How does Qtpi handle inactive profiles and bots?
We actively monitor user activity and penalize inactive profiles and bots, ensuring that only engaged and intentional users are part of the dating pool. This helps maintain a vibrant and authentic community.

## What privacy measures does Qtpi have in place?
Qtpi prioritizes your privacy by only sharing your full profile with mutual matches. Additionally, we use end-to-end encryption for all messages, ensuring that only you and your match can read your conversations.

## Can I control what personal information I share?
Absolutely! Users have control over their personal information. You will only see multiple-choice answers from the questionnaire and scrambled photos until you decide to match. Even after matching, only usernames are exchanged until you choose to share more.

## What is the Web of Trust, and how does it work?
The Web of Trust is a special feature in our dating app designed to enhance safety and authenticity. It allows users to gauge the trustworthiness of profiles through in-person verification. The system operates on three levels: Verify, Connect, and Trust, helping to build a community of trust among users.

### How does the verification process work?

Verification is done in person using Bluetooth technology. When you meet someone from the app, you can easily verify each other by pressing a button in the app. This method is more secure than using QR codes, which can be easily manipulated.

### What are the different levels of trust?

There are three levels of trust in our system:

1. **Verify**: This level is for strangers or people you meet through the app. You can verify each other to build trust within the community.

2. **Connect**: This level is for people you know in real life who are also on the app. It signifies a higher level of trust than verification.

3. **Trust**: This is the highest level of trust, reserved for your best friends and family members who are also on the app.

### Can I change my trust levels for others?

Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your trust levels for other users at any time, depending on your relationship with them.

### Why is this system important?

The Web of Trust system helps create a safer and more trustworthy environment within the app. By allowing users to verify and build connections based on real-life relationships, we aim to foster a community where everyone feels more secure when meeting new people.

### What are the benefits of using a Web of Trust system compared to standard verification methods used in other dating apps?

- **Community-Based Trust**: The Web of Trust relies on a network of verified connections, allowing users to gauge trustworthiness based on relationships with people they already know. This community-driven approach fosters a sense of safety and accountability, as users can see how many people they trust have verified someone.

- **In-Person Verification**: Unlike standard verification methods that may rely on photo uploads or social media links, the Web of Trust emphasizes in-person verification through Bluetooth technology. This adds an extra layer of security, as it ensures that users are who they claim to be in real life.

- **Multiple Levels of Trust**: The Web of Trust system features three distinct levels of trust—Verify, Connect, and Trust—allowing users to express varying degrees of confidence in others. This nuanced approach helps users make more informed decisions about who to interact with based on their relationship with that person.

- **Reduced Risk of Fake Profiles**: By requiring in-person verification and leveraging existing social connections, the Web of Trust helps reduce the prevalence of fake profiles and catfishing. Users are more likely to feel secure knowing that their connections have been vetted by people they trust.

- **Empowerment Through Choice**: Users have the ability to choose who they verify, connect with, or trust, giving them more control over their interactions. This empowerment can lead to more meaningful connections and a stronger sense of community within the app.

- **Enhanced Safety**: The Web of Trust system is designed to create a safer dating environment by encouraging users to build relationships based on real-life interactions and mutual trust. This can lead to a more positive and secure experience when meeting new people.
